# Calendar prototype

This application was developed in order to train and get better at using Flutter.
The main idea was to create a simple calendar, where the user could add meals for
every day.

This project taught me a lot, it also showed me that my bottleneck at the moment is
state management. I'll study it more and, certainly, my next flutter applications 
will be better than this one.
